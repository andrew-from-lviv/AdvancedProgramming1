# AdvancedProgramming1
The first assignment for the Advanced Programming course.
The whole folder was submitted to the repo, so it could be just downloaded and run
Three tasks (in the src/java...):
Never use switch (In a separate package there is a replacement with polymorphism and another example in the CharactersFactory (with dictionary).
Game one (uncomment part of code in the main method to run it)
Game two (the default code in the main method - simulating the fight between two Characters)
